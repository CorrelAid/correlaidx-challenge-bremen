## How to use

With our application you can gain insights into commuting behaviour in Germany, both on the level of "Länder" (NUTS-1) and "Kreise" (NUTS-3). You can visualize data as sortable tables with bar plots or presented as a map. For NUTS-1 there is also a time-sereis graph available.

The panel on the left lets you choose  
… a year between 2011 and 2019 for which numbers are shown  
… whether to show commuter inflow, outflow, or balance  
… whether numbers are absolute or in proportion to the regions populations  
… and if you like to download the data as a .csv-file.

You can also download the maps as images in different file formats.
